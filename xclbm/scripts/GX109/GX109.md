## GX109
steps of processing GX109 dataset.

### Dataset preprocessing
GX109 is a 10x Genomics scRNA-seq dataset. 
- The fastq files (not stored in our server, **source?**) were aligned to GRCh38 
  (CellRanger refdata GRCh38-1.2.0) with CellRanger-count (v2.2.0) pipeline. 
  The cmdline is `/groups/cgsd/yuanhua/samples/scRNA/GX109-T1c/_cmdline`.

### Summary of dataset
CellRanger output is at `/groups/cgsd/yuanhua/samples/scRNA/GX109-T1c/`.
- bam file: ~79G
- cell barcodes: 5400
